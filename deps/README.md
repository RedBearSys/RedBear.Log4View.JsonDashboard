# Binary Dependencies

## Purpose
These are third party files which are not available in a public package library and to which Red Bear Systems Limited has no IPR or copyright claim.

The files included within this folder are sufficient for you to *build* our software, but these files will not *run* without a full installation of the third party product. You should ensure you have an appropriate licence to use any such software.

## Rights Holders
Our reasoning for taking this approach is that a user should be able to clone the repository and *just build*. A user shouldn't be expected to have to adjust reference paths and user-specific reference paths shouldn't get committed back to this repository.

We have taken care not to include any files that aren't already available without payment (e.g. in demonstration versions of the software).

Should you still have any concerns with regards to the content of this folder, please [create an issue](https://github.com/RedBearSys/RedBear.Log4View.JsonDashboard/issues/new) and we'll respond as soon as we can.
