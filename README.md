## Getting Started
Either build the code yourself or install using [this installer](https://rbpublic.blob.core.windows.net/log4view/RedBear.Log4View.JsonDashboard.Setup.msi). The plugin must be installed into the "Log4View" folder in "Program Files (x86)".

You can then make the JSON View appear by enabling it in the `Window` menu. JSON View can then be dragged so that it appears as a tab beneath your messages, for example:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedBearSys/RedBear.Log4View.JsonDashboard/master/media/screenshot.png" width="500" />

Values can be copied and pasted either by right-clicking on a value node and choosing `Copy Value` from the context menu, or by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
